    <h1>Conversational Interfaces: Where Are We Today? Where Are We Heading?</h1>
    <aside>By Cosima Mielke</aside>
    <p> Computers and human beings don’t speak the same language.
      So, to make interaction possible, we rely on graphical user interfaces
      (GUIs). But GUIs come with a natural barrier: People have to learn to use them.
      They have to learn that a hamburger button hides a menu, that a button triggers
      an action. But with technology evolving and language recognition and processing
      improving, we are on a path that could make interaction with digital services
      more intuitive, more accessible and more efficient — through conversational interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>Virtual assistants that live inside messaging apps could help us arrange a trip,
      shop online, order a ride or even do banking — all powered by chat. Already today,
      the number of applications that rely on friendly conversation to nurture relationships with
      customers is growing. In this article, we will look at the current state of conversational interfaces,
      the challenges they bring and where things are heading.</p>
